=====================================
PyHalo - halo modelling for cosmology
=====================================

This is a Python implementation of the halokit_ library. This code implements the power spectrum backend for the halo modelling and the release version does not include code to perform halo density profile calculations. Much of the release code is also (and better) implemented in Roban Kramer's cosmolopy_ library.

It is plausible that further work on this code will be performed in the future; a fork by Henrik Brink (brinkar) that extends the code considerably already exists and may be posted separately.
